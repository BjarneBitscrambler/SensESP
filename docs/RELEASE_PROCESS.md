# SensESP release process

1. Create a new `release` branch (or rebase an existing one)

2. Update autogenerated html and js source files:

    pio run -e d1_mini -t webUI

   Remember to commit the results.

3. Update the doxygen docs (first bump the version number in `Doxyfile`)

    doxygen

   Again, commit the results.

4. Push the changes to `upstream` `release` branch. This is the release branch
   from which the actual release is made. 

5. Verify that everything looks OK in the SignalK/SensESP `release` branch.

6. Create (or rebase) a new local `latest` branch. Push that to
   `upstream` `latest`.

7. Navigate to https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/releases and click on 
   "Draft a new release". Tag version is "x.y.z". Be sure to select `latest`
   branch. Title is ordinarily "Version x.y.z". Description would ideally
   be a listing of new features and bugfixes.

8. The release is now done. Finally, create a PR from `latest` to `master`
   and merge it. This will bring `master` up to date with the released version.
